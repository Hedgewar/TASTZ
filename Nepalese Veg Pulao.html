     Here is a step-by-step recipe for Nepalese Vegetable Pulao:
     <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
     2 cups Basmati rice
     1/2 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera)
     1/2 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi)
     1 Bay leaf (tej patta)
     4 Cloves (Laung)
     2 Black cardamom (Badi Elaichi)
     1/2 Inch Cinnamon Stick (Dalchini)
     1/2 Tablespoon Ginger Garlic Paste
     4 Green Chillies , minced
      1 Onion , finely chopped
      1 Tomato , finely chopped
     1/2 Cup Green peas (Matar)
     Salt , to taste
     Oil , as needed
     1 Tablespoon Lemon juice
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
     1. Soak 2 cups of Basmati rice in water for at least 30 minutes before cooking.
     2. Heat oil in a kadai or heavy-bottomed pan. Once the oil is mildly hot, add 1/2 teaspoon of cumin seeds, 1 bay leaf, 4 cloves, 2 black cardamom, and 1/2 inch cinnamon stick. Let them cook on low heat till you start getting the fragrance of these spices. This will take 15 to 20 seconds.
     3. Add 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder, 1/2 tablespoon of ginger-garlic paste, and 4 minced green chillies. Cook for another minute.
     4. Add 1 finely chopped onion, 1 finely chopped tomato, and 1/2 cup of green peas into the pan. Cook on low heat for 3-5 minutes.
     5. Drain water from soaked rice and add the rice into the pan. Give it a good stir to mix everything properly.
     6. Add about 2 cups of water and salt to taste. Stir again, cover it and cook it for 15 to 20 minutes.
     7. When the rice is almost cooked, add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and mix it again. Cook for a few more minutes and switch off once done.
      Enjoy your meal! ðŸ˜Š
