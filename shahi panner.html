Shahi Paneer is a delicious Indian dish of soft paneer cubes in a rich and creamy gravy. It is usually served with naan, roti, or rice. Here are the step by step instructions to make it at home:
<h3>Instructions</h3>
1. Soak 10 almonds and 10 cashew nuts in warm water for 15 minutes. Peel the almonds and grind them with the cashew nuts to a smooth paste. Keep aside.
2. Heat 2 tbsp of oil in a pan and add 1 tsp of cumin seeds, 2 cloves, 2 green cardamoms, and a small piece of cinnamon. Fry for a few seconds until fragrant.
3. Add 1 cup of finely chopped onion and fry until golden brown. Add 1 tbsp of ginger-garlic paste and fry for another minute.
4. Add 1/4 cup of tomato puree and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add salt, 1/4 tsp of turmeric powder, 1/2 tsp of red chilli powder, 1/4 tsp of garam masala, and 1/4 tsp of sugar. Mix well and cook for another 5 minutes.
5. Add the almond-cashew paste and 1/4 cup of water. Bring the gravy to a boil and then lower the heat. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
6. Add 1/4 cup of fresh cream and 2 tbsp of grated khoya (milk solids). Mix well and cook for another 5 minutes.
7. Add 250 g of paneer cubes and gently mix them with the gravy. Cook for 5 minutes or until the paneer is soft and heated through.
8. Sprinkle some saffron soaked in warm milk, 1 tsp of honey, and a few drops of kewra essence (optional) over the shahi paneer. Garnish with some chopped coriander leaves and serve hot.
