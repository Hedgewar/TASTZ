    Here is a recipe for Baby Corn Masala that you can try:
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    200 to 250 grams baby corn
    1 medium-sized onion or â…“ cup chopped onions
    3 medium-sized tomatoes or 1.5 cups chopped tomatoes
    3 to 4 small to medium garlic cloves, peeled
    1 inch ginger, peeled and chopped
    1 green chili, chopped
    1 black cardamom (optional)
    1 inch cinnamon
    2 green cardamoms
    2 cloves
    1 single, thin strand of mace (optional)
    Â¼ cup chopped or broken cashews
    2 tablespoons magaz (melon seeds)
    1 teaspoon coriander powder
    Â½ teaspoon red chili powder
    Â¼ teaspoon turmeric powder
    Â¼ teaspoon garam masala
    3 tablespoons oil
    1 tej patta (Indian bay leaf)
    Crushed kasuri methi (dry fenugreek leaves)
    Salt as required
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
    
    In a blender or grinder, add the onion, tomatoes, garlic, ginger, green chili, black cardamom, cinnamon, green cardamoms, cloves, mace, cashews, and magaz. 

    Grind to a smooth paste with some water.

    Heat oil in a heavy pan or kadai.

    Keeping heat to a low, add the tej patta.

    Fry the leaf till fragrant and then add the ground masala paste.

    Continue to sautÃ© and stir pretty often.

     After 10 to 12 minutes, add the coriander powder, red chili powder, turmeric powder, and garam masala.

    Continue sautÃ©ing till the whole masala starts coming together.

    This sautÃ©ing process takes approximately 20 to 25 minutes on low to medium heat. 

    So one needs patience and time when doing this method.

     Also, the masala has to be stirred quite often.

     You will see oil leaving the sides of the masala and it will gather together and also look glossy.

    When the masala paste is sautÃ©ed well, add water and chopped baby corn. 

    Bring the curry to a boil and then simmer for 10 to 12 minutes on low to medium heat till the baby corn gravy thickens and you get a medium consistency gravy.

    Lastly, add crushed kasuri methi and salt as required. 

    Stir and check the taste of baby corn curry. 

    Add more salt, red chili powder, or garam masala powder if required.

    This recipe is vegan and makes for a comforting meal when paired with Indian flatbreads or steamed rice.

     Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š
